This is a small project that utilize ANN model to recognize hand-written digits.
There are 2 files in this project

1.digitsData.mat
  This is a file contains all 5000 hand-written digits from 0 to 9 for this project. Each digit has 500 data.

2.neuronNetwork.py
  This file contains all the model set up.
  
Use python to build neuronNetwork.py to get the model's correctness rate on the test set.
